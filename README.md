### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Shawn. 
As indicated on my current profile, haven't been actively working on pushing updates on existing projects and introduce new projects since last summmer.

Things I am currently spending the most effort on: 
- Academic success
  As a student who transfer to IB midway, it requires me to spend much more effort than other students to be sucessful in the program (earning 40+ points) on behalf the fact that the IB is really a streeful program

- Competitive programming (C++)
  While web development is a really cool skill, but university doesn't care about it too much. In order to get prepare for the top program in the top university, participating in the competitive programming seems to be the compromise I had to make. 
  
  Google kickstart: could able to solve question one and question two  and sometimes even question 3 with some luck, but not question four. 
  
  Codechef: questions among the 2200 - 2500 (6* level)
  
- React.js 
  While vanilla JS has improved decently through the two decades (as indicates by the decreasing popularity jQuery, a library originally to improve the functionality and fix the problems of Javascript), the general trade still indicates it is necessary to have a decent skills in some popular JS libraries (e.g. Angular, React.js, Vue.js). Currently exploring React.js for multiple pages webpage (really a pain using vanilla JS for multi-pages webpage). 

- Write standard and clear code
The [stock market application](https://github.com/Caloverys/stock-market) is the longest application I have made, but as the file becomes bigger and bigger, the problem of writing messy and in a big file becomes obvious: very hard to start efficiantly and experience hard a time to find what to start with. However, I am planning to redesign and recode the whole project after I finished my IB May exam as this project is still my passion about.
